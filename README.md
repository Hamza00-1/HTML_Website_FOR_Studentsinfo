# Students Information Portal

## Project Overview
This project is a collaborative web portal designed to showcase student profiles, academic modules, and professional curriculum vitae (CVs). It serves as a centralized hub for student information, featuring both a pure HTML version and an enhanced version with CSS styling.

## Key Features
- **Student Profiles**: Individual pages for group members including Hamza Khchichine, Imad Adnane, Mouad Nhiri, Brahim Nakkar, and Hadil Boutaouar.
- **Academic Modules**: Detailed pages for various university modules such as:
    - Advanced Algorithms
    - Advanced Networking
    - Software Engineering
    - Web Security
- **Dual Implementation**:
    - **Sans_CSS**: A raw HTML implementation focusing on structure and semantic markup.
    - **Avec_Css**: An aesthetically enhanced version utilizing CSS for layout and design.
- **Group CV**: A collective CV page (`CV_GRP.html`) highlighting the group's combined skills and experiences.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into the following main directories:
- `/Sans_CSS`: Contains the website files without any CSS styling.
- `/Avec_Css`: Contains the website files with CSS styling applied.
- `main.html`: The primary entry point and navigation hub for the portal.
- Individual module and student files (e.g., `WebSecure.html`, `modules-hamza.html`).

## How to Use
1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Open `main.html` in any modern web browser to access the portal.
3.  Navigate through the student profiles and academic modules using the interactive table on the home page.
4.  Switch between the `Sans_CSS` and `Avec_Css` directories to compare the impact of styling on the user interface.
